This WordPress plugin is built exclusively for the Fictioneer theme, version 5.19.0 or higher. It enables guests and users to subscribe to selected content updates via email. You can choose to receive notifications for all new content, specific post types, or individual stories and taxonomies. The plugin is compatible with all cache plugins.

Currently, the plugin is integrated with the [MailerSend](https://www.mailersend.com/) email service provider. MailerSend offers a generous free plan of 3,000 emails per month and bulk emails. This should last you a long time before you need a paid plan, at which point you should have the support to afford it.

## Installation

Same as the Fictioneer theme, the plugin is not available from the official library and needs to be installed and updated manually.

1. Download the zip file from the [latest release](https://github.com/Tetrakern/fictioneer-email-notifications/releases).
2. In your WordPress dashboard, go to **Plugins > Add New Plugin**.
3. Click on **Upload Plugin** at the top.
4. Select the downloaded zip file and click **Install Now**.
5. Activate the plugin once the installation is complete.
